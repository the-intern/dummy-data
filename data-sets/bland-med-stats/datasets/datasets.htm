<p>
If you use any of these data sets in publications or teaching material, please
acknowledge both the author(s) of the paper and the original suppliers of the
data where given.

<p>
Data-sets are in Stata dictionary format.  They are plain text ASCII files.
There is a list of variables and then the data in a rectangular array.  You may
need to edit out the dictionary, but with little modification they should be
readable by any statistical program.  The missing data code is a dot, ".".
